- 👋 Hi i'm Kristian Hansson, an aspiring full-stack developer currently enrolled at Kodehode/Jobloop.
- 👀 I’m interested in figuring out the logic of why something works! Delving deep into a particular subject and learning its ins and outs is my specialty!  ;)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and C#, still learning some HTML/CSS when working on projects but for now JS and C# is my main focus. I am enrolled at kodehode/jobloop, where i am taking a course on web development. The course teaches Javascript aswell as React. C# and .NET i am currently learning on the side and loving it!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun and challenging projects. I can work on something i don't have a full understanding on, as long as people understand that learning takes away some efficiency!
